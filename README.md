# Drift Principle

The Drift Principle states that when systems accelerate or increase in
complexity faster than their participants can integrate meaning, coherence
will degrade even if performance metrics remain stable.

The principle describes how drift emerges not from failure or collapse, but
from sustained mismatch between system dynamics and human cognitive limits.
